                              // introduction to java
 how java code is executed in java?

 first of all we write a code which is in .javafile  .after it compiler compile the whole code and make a
 .class file which is also known as byte code then java interpreter execute this code line by line and
 convert it into machine code also known as(binary form);

 1: our writen code is not directly run to run this we need jvm(java virtual machine)
 2: thats why java is also known as platform independent.
 why java is platform independent?

 1:  in c and c++ source code is directly converted into machine readable code .
 2:  while in java first source code is converted into byte code and then into
 machine readable code (binary form).
 3: byte code can run on all operating systems.
 4:  so when java compiler converts source code into byte code then byte code runs
 on any operating system.
                        that's why java is platform independent.

to run java program we need a environment lets discuss come terms and tools that are used in java

what is JDK;
1: jdk is known as java development kit. it provide environment to run java program
2: it is package that includes
    * development tool.
    * JRE (java runtime environment) to execute your program.
    * a compiler (javaC).
    * archiver  (jar).
    * docs generator (java doc).
    * interpreter.


what is java compiler?
A Java compiler is a program that takes the text file work of a developer and compiles it into a platform-independent
Java file. Java compilers include the Java Programming Language Compiler (javac),
 the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ), the Eclipse Compiler for Java ( ECJ ) and Jikes .

what is java interpreter?
The Java interpreter translates Java bytecode (.class files) into code that the operating system can comprehend.
